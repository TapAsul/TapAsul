   QUICK START — three things to change before you publish:
     1. brand.url ............... your real domain  (line ~35)
     2. order.admin.pin .......... your dashboard PIN (search "pin:")
     3. order.mode ............... how bookings reach you (search "mode:")

   After you change your domain, run:
       node tools/build-seo.js
   …or set that as the build command on Cloudflare Pages and it runs for you.

  faq: [
    {
      q: "How does the TapAsul Digital Card work?",
      a: "TapAsul uses embedded NFC (Near Field Communication) chips. When tapped against any modern iOS or Android smartphone, it instantly opens your custom dynamic landing page — allowing clients to save your contact info or view links without installing any app.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the {hosting} monthly hosting fee for?",
      a: "The {hosting} monthly subscription maintains your dynamic web page server, analytics tracking, contact vCard download links, and allows you to request real-time updates to your contact details anytime.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can my card open my Google Business review page or my socials?",
      a: "Yes — that is what the card is for. Tell us which links you want when you book (a Google Business review page, your socials, your menu, your portfolio). You can change them later at any time, without reprinting the card, as long as the hosting is active.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between the standard and the premium card?",
      a: "The standard card is our own artwork — printed, programmed and handed to you at your appointment. The premium card is {premium} and includes your own logo and colours, a premium card finish, priority appointment slots and unlimited artwork revisions. Its hosting is {premiumHosting} a month.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to install an app?",
      a: "No. NFC works natively on iPhone 7 and newer (iOS 11+) and on essentially all modern Android phones. Your customer taps, a link opens in their browser, and that's it.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to get my card?",
      a: "Most cards are printed, programmed and handed to you during your appointment. If you would rather have it delivered, production and delivery within Metro Manila typically takes 5–7 working days after artwork approval, and 7–12 working days provincial. You will receive a tracking number by email.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I get analytics on my card?",
      a: "Yes. We record the date, the city and roughly how each tap happened, and we share that with you — ask us any time and we will send you the report. Tap counts show you which card is actually being used. We do not read or store anything about the person who tapped.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I update my details after the card is printed?",
      a: "Yes, and that is the point of a digital card. Your contact details, links, socials and photo can be changed at any time, without reprinting the card — just email us and we will update it, usually the same day. The hosting fee covers this for as long as you keep it active.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much is shipping and how do I get my card?",
      a: "Delivery is charged before you confirm, so the total you see is the total you pay. We ship with a tracked courier and you get the tracking number by email. Or choose \"Collect at my appointment\" and there is no delivery fee at all.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does the monthly hosting fee include?",
      a: "Your live tap profile (contact card, links, socials and photo), tap analytics, unlimited edits to those details, the hosting itself, and support. It does not include a new physical card — that is billed separately as a replacement.",
    },
    {
      q: "What material is the card made of, and how thick is it?",
      a: "It is a matte PVC card with an embedded NFC chip — roughly the thickness of a normal bank card, so it fits in a standard wallet. The cut edge is white, and the card is sealed so it survives a bag or a pocket.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I get more than one profile on the same card, or replace a card later?",
      a: "Yes. Extra profiles and replacement cards are available as add-ons in the booking form, so you can see the price before you commit. A replacement is printed with the same artwork you already approved.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I have to come to your office to get my card?",
      a: "No — but most people prefer to. You book a date and time, we print and program your card while you wait, and you walk out with it in about 30 minutes. If you cannot come in, choose delivery and we will ship the finished card to you.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is your refund policy?",
      a: "Because every card is printed to your own design, we cannot resell it. Bookings cancelled more than 24 hours before your appointment are refunded in full, less any delivery fee already paid. Once production starts, a custom-printed card cannot be refunded. Read the full Refund Policy before you book.",
